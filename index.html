                <h2>My YCDI Metaverse Project</h2>
                <h3>September 27, 2022 by Kareem Ellis</h3>
                <p>
                    During my tenure as a change agent at Youth Can Do IT (YCDI) I was 
                    tasked with designing and modeling a metaverse space. The purpose of the space
                    was to house the annual event hosted by YCDI called #iamWITy or I am a Woman in Technology
                    which empowers young women to enter the tech industry. <img src="poster.jpeg" alt="Poster of YCDI event"><br>
                    Despite learning how to do it from scratch, I created a space using for Mozilla Hubs
                    using a platform called Mozilla Spoke. This allowed for people to join the event through several platforms
                    which includes mobile, laptop or desktop and of course on virtual reality headsets such as 
                    the Meta Quest 2. <img src="avatar.jpeg" alt="Picture of avatars in Mozilla Hubs">

                <h2>I completed my first internship</h2>
                <h3>September 27, 2022 by Kareem Ellis</h3>
                <p>
                    During the summer of 2022, I landed an internship position as a developer at a startup company called
                    One-on-One Educational Services Limited. This internship made use of my current level of Web Development knowledge.
                    I learned about and used cypress, a Javascript End to End Testing Framework to write automated
                    tests for their websites. <img src="cypress.png" alt="Picture of using Cypress framework"><br>
                    At the end of the internship I was granted a contract as a part time contractor to to continue testing
                    their platforms. I am currently working as a contractor there today.
